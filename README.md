# Line Following Robot

## Overview
Hi! This is a Line Following Robot built using **Arduino Uno** and **IR sensors**. It can autonomously follow a predefined path, making it a great project for learning basic robotics and embedded systems.

## Features
- Detects and follows a line using IR sensors
- Controlled by an Arduino Uno
- Demonstrates motor control and sensor interfacing

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor Module
- DC Motors & Motor Driver
- Chassis & Wheels
- Battery Pack

## How It Works
IR sensors detect the line on the surface. Based on the sensor input, the Arduino controls the motors to keep the robot following the path.

## Usage
1. Connect the IR sensors and motors to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.  
2. Upload the Arduino code to the board.  
3. Place the robot on a track, and it will follow the line automatically.

## Learning Outcomes
- Basics of robotics and autonomous systems
- Sensor integration and motor control
- Hands-on embedded system programming
